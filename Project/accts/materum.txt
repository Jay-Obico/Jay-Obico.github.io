MATERUM, LAWRENCE Y.
Full Professor
Electronics And Communications Engineering
Lawrence Materum received the B.Sc. degree in electronics and communications engineering with honors and scholarship from Mapúa Institute of Technology (now Mapúa University), the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering major in computers and communications from the University of the Philippines Diliman through an Analog Devices Fellowship, and the Ph.D. degree in international development engineering (major in electrical/electronics engineering) from Tokyo Institute of Technology through a MEXT Scholarship. After receiving his M.S. degree, he co-developed integrated circuit tests for cellular and emerging radio chips at Analog Devices. As an industry-academia-government collaboration researcher-engineer in the Research Institute of Electrical Communication of Tohoku University, he developed and co-proposed the first radio non-line-of-sight wideband indoor channel models for 60-GHz beamforming. He received the best paper award at the 13th International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation for his contribution to unsupervised learning of the grouping of electromagnetic signals, which is crucial for knowing various characteristics of such signals and the development of wireless channel models. Currently, he is a faculty of the Electronics and Communications Engineering Department of De La Salle University. He is in the field of telecommunications, and his recent interests include but not limited to propagation channel (measurements, analysis, modeling), adaptive antenna arrays, wireless sensing, unsupervised and supervised machine learning, pattern estimation of random processes, forecasting of momentum stochastic processes, and sustainable technology transitions.
